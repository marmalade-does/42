## UP NEXT
* remove the things at in_cleaning.c:80
* it uses functions like 
* cheeeck that all your frees are correct. I'm espcecially worried about one in ft_sort_big()
* Need double check the sort_4_functions
* in_cleaning1.c:44 remove the printf that says "There was a repeat number in the input"

Remember:
pa - push to a
ra - first element turns last
rra - last element is first
GRAAAAAAAAA

pa -- to a from b
pb -- to b from a
