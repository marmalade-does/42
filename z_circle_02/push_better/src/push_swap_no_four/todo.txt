what to do now

 
* Need to initialise the memory for stack_b in the push_swap_no_four/sort_main_be:14

* go through the push_swap og files sid-by-side with the *_be files and
mak sure the be files have all the auxiliary functions that they need 
-- make sure that they also have correct pointers and stuff.
